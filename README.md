  Solidity Assighment -1

1) Write a program to calculate the cube of a given number.
2) Write a program to check whether a given number is even or odd. If even return 1 else return O.
3) Write a program to find the Average of three numbers.
4) Write a program to swap two numbers using a third variable.
5) Write a program to calculate the power of a number where x and y are two numbers and you have to calculate x"y.
6) Write a program to swap two numbers without using a third variable.
7) Write a program to check given number is prime or not. If prime return 1 else O;
   A prime is a number that can be divided exactly only by itself and 1, for example, 7,17, and 41.
8) Write a program to check whether an integer is an Armstrong number or not.
   An Armstrong number is one whose sum of digits raised to the power n equals the number itself.
   Where n is the number of digits.
   371 is an Armstrong number because 3"3 + 7Â°3 + 1"3 = 371. Here n= 3
   1634 is not an Armstrong number because 1"4+6"4+3"4+4"4 is not equal to 1634. Here n=4
9) Write a program to find the greatest among three integers.
10)Write a program to check whether a number is a palindrome or not. If palindrome return 1 else O;
   A palindrome number is a number that remains the same when digits are reversed.
   For example, the number 12321 is a palindrome number.
11) Write a program to reverse an integer.
12) Write a program to find the sum of the digits of a number.
    If the digit is 123 then the program should return 1+2+3 i.e. 6
13) Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number.
    A factorial of 4 is 1x2x3x4 = 24
    A factorial of 6 is 1x2x3x4x5 = 120
14) Write a program to find the nth Fibonacci number.
    The Fibonacci number is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
    The simplest is the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.
15) Write a program to do multiplication operation without using multiplication operator.


Solidity Assignment - 2

1) Write a program to concatenate two strings.
2) Write a program to compare two strings whether they are equal or not. If equal return true otherwise false.
3) Write a program to search for a number in an array.
4) Write a program to find the largest in an array.
5) Write a program to sort an array in increasing order. The array can have negative as well as positive numbers.
6) Write a program to return an array in reverse order.
7) Write a program to insert an element at a given location in an Array. Consider the array to be empty initially.
8) Write a program to find the sum of array elements.
9) Write a program to create a student struct having the student's name, roll number, and age. Write a
   function to insert a student, and return the student's details.
10) Write a program to store the student details of 10 students. Use the same student structure as you
    have created above.
11) Create a mapping from the address to an array(uint type) of length 3.
    Where index=0 represents marks in Math, index=1 represents marks in English, and index=2 represents
    marks in History.
    Write a function to insert marks of an address and return marks of an address.
12) Create a mapping from the address to the Student struct(created above at 9). Store the details in
    the mapping and return details.
13) Create a mapping(address=>mapping(address=>bool)).
    Write a function by the name of "transferOwnership" which change the status of mapping to true when
    the ownership is transferred from address 1 to address 2.
    Write a function by the name of 'ownershipStatus' which returns the status of the ownership.
14) Create a dynamic string array. And perform the operation of push, pop, and return the entire array.
15) Create an enum House having members SMALL,MEDIUM and LARGE.
    Create a function to insert the house value and get the house value.
